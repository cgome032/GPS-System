# GPS System
Project for CS122A class

## Purpose
I took on the task of creating a small personal gps system.  The gps system will be able to track your current location, determine the amount of distance covered, real time speed, and, with an internet connection, the current address you are located at.  There will be the main user screen and two buttons that will allow the user to switch between the 3 different options, giving the user the information they are looking for.
